\textit{Computer Science Teacher} \hfill Sep 2020 - Mar 2023\\
\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize} \itemsep 1pt
	\item Brought cutting edge CS education down to the middle school level for the first time in district.
	\item Created and ran an Esports program. 90\% of admitted players started below the 40th percentile and finished above 80th percentile in the games\textquotesingle{} global rankings.
	\item Three interstate Esport tournament first place wins against 150+ competitors within our fist year.
	\item Established Robotics Summer camp where 7th and 8th graders went from never coding to building and coding autonomous battlebots in one week.
	\item Working with local professors and high school teachers, led the development of 8th grade CS curriculum at a one week Sienna College Computer Science Education conference; setting the standard for NYS middle school Computer Science.
	\item Led workshopping days where I helped other 8th grade technology teachers with minimal coding knowledge understand and implement the CS curriculum.
	\item Managed an annual technology budget of \$13,000 dollars. Used this to order robot kits, 3D printers, and many other tools.
	\item Worked with architects to emphasize the tech departments needs in a \$83M renovation plan. Leveraged this to get the school an Esports room, and state of the art industrial engineering facilities.
